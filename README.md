# MapTest

This is to show, and ask for help with a problem I am having involving Leaflet JS.

This generates a map and attempts to place a set of circles and default markers in a cross. The markers and circles do not line up, and shift in relation to each other as you zoom in and out.

When zoomed in you may note that the markers are particularly close, to the point where the 2 crosses overlap each other.

When zoomed out the markers are no where near the circles.

Lastly the markers that form a cross slowly lose the cross shape as you zoom out.

In addition, the shadow of the icon has a image that also drifts to a lesser degree, and does not load.
